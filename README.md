PyToolTests
===========

Testing code using PyROOT bindings for dual-use tool configuration.

## Python <-> C++ tool configuration

In this example, the tool is instantiated in C++ and passed to a user-specified
python function for configuration. TPython is used for the PyObject binding,
and some Python API code is used to pass the tool to python functions. The tool
is first pythonized so that tool properties can be set as attributes.
